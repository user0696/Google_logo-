# Google_logo-
It my first Css repo.Just try some css and desing this logo.


The Google logo features the company's name in the familiar blue, red, yellow, and green color scheme. The letters are set in a custom font called "Product Sans," which was designed in-house by Google. The logo is meant to be simple and modern, reflecting the company's mission to make information accessible to everyone. The company has occasionally made changes to the logo, such as during holidays or special events.
